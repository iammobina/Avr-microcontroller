# Avr microcontroller

There are several different implementations of projects for the AVR microcontroller (ATmega or ATmega32) in this repository:

1) Az1 directory: Blinking LED with different frequency(without using delay)
2) Az2 directory: A simple controller for a car
3) Az3 directory: A digital clock that displays time and date in 7 segments(without using delay)
4) Az4 directory: Display data on seven segments using zero-timers and using language C
5) Az5 directory: From right to left, LED matrix plates display alphabets A to F
6) Az6 directory: Display the time and date on a LCD character screen
7) Az7 directory: Temperature measurement with LM35 sensor and LDC display
8) Az8 directory: A calculator 
9) Az9 directory: Serial port
10) Az10 directory: Interrupts
11) Az11 directory: Time and Date measurement with I2C
12) Az12 directory: Displaying a shape(a house) on the Graphic LCD
13) Az13 directory: Morse code decoder
14) Az14 directory: Client-server communication
